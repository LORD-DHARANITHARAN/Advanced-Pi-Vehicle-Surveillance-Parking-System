APVSP is a surveillance parking system which is used to measure the high security and surveillance of the VIP's Vehicle's safety and their premium quality parking.

  Advanced Pi Vehicle Surveillance Parking [ APVSP ] is a surveillance parking system which is used to measure the high security and surveillance of the VIP's Vehicle's safety and their premium quality parking.
	This project was constructed with the help of machine learning tools like Opencv, Pytesseract, Numpy and some other networking tools. This project was designed with the Hardwares like Raspberry pi 4 model B, 5MP raspbian camera, Monitor, Ethernet Cable (LAN Networking) and Charging Cable(3V). Some more customisable parts like RPI fan and Case for safe device handling.
	It was running on our RPI with the help of an SD card which we already installed on the OS. Our project, which belongs to a python program running under some modules which we already mentioned above. It Deducts the Number Plate of the vehicle and Digitalizes those Characters. And also submit those characters via mail to the respective Admin. These images are not taken by automatic due to server managing issues and data management. It's a Command like UI for getting Number plate Characters. This information was transmitted to Admin with the Networking Protocol (SMTP). This protocol is used to share the information via Email like a postman. 
	This Operation was used to find the Vehicles under theft and keep safe from vulnerability in normal parking. It was also considered as an IOT project. An easier explanation was already shown in the respective Block Diagram.
